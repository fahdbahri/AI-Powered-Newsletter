Recommendation for Enterprise AI Model That Quickly Ingests Streaming Phone Conversations,"So I'm asking about best RAG AI models for an Enterprise app that would be best at real time processing of a phone conversation. So very few prompts are manually input (maybe clarifications after output)

I've reviewed docs for many models but without testing hard to know and I'm limited in development skills.

Can the model ingest the audio stream or does it need a real time transcription which is then fed as a prompt? Obviously this is an additional step so a model that can handle the actual streaming audio would be interesting. For instance an API into Twilio or Amazon Connect.","Recommendation for Enterprise AI Model That Quickly Ingests Streaming Phone Conversations.

"given the rich-poor dynamic of the conflict in gaza, do the positions of ceos of top ai firms on gaza, or their silence, reveal the impact of these companies owning the most powerful ais on the planet? ","


sam altman says openai will maintain its non-profit mission of serving humanity as it converts to a for profit corporation. google's motto is ""do the right thing.""

do the positions of the ceos of top ai corporations on gaza, or their silence, serve as an indicator of how sincere they are about their professed mission to serve humanity?

i leave this to you to determine. 

let's start with gemini 2.0 flash experimental addressing the conflict in gaza in terms of its rich versus poor dynamic.

gemini 2.0 flash experimental:

""In the lead-up to the present conflict, the Gaza Strip faced severe economic hardship due to the ongoing blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since 2007. This blockade crippled Gaza's economy, restricting movement of goods and people, limiting access to essential resources, and contributing to high unemployment and poverty. This economic deprivation, coupled with recurring escalations of violence and destruction of infrastructure, created a volatile environment. This situation is further contextualized by the fact that many Palestinians, including those living within Israel, experience systemic discrimination and are often regarded as second-class citizens. This includes limitations on access to land, housing, employment, and basic services, further exacerbating the economic disparities between Israelis and Palestinians. The pre-existing economic disparity and the context of discrimination against Palestinians formed a crucial backdrop to the current conflict, highlighting a rich-versus-poor dynamic with historical and political underpinnings.""

below 2.0 cites the positions, or silence, of some of our top ai ceos on what is happening in gaza:

""Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, has publicly addressed the situation in Gaza by condemning the Hamas attacks and acknowledging the pain and suffering of those affected on both sides. He announced that Google would donate $8 million in grants to nonprofits providing relief to civilians in Israel and Gaza, including support for organizations aiding people in Gaza. Pichai also emphasized the importance of supporting Google employees in the region, recognizing the impact of the conflict on their well-being and acknowledging the concerns of Jewish, Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim Googlers.

Satya Nadella has publicly expressed his stance on the situation in Gaza. He has condemned the Hamas attacks on Israel and expressed his condolences to the victims. However, he has not publicly commented on the Israeli military response in Gaza.

Sam Altman's posting of an Israeli flag on X can be interpreted as an expression of solidarity with Israel, an alignment with its perspective on the conflict, or a reflection of personal or business connections. This act, however, carries potential implications. It could be perceived as taking sides in a highly polarized conflict, alienating those supporting the Palestinian cause, especially within the tech community he previously emphasized inclusivity for. 

Unfortunately, there is no publicly available information about Dario Amodei's specific position on the current situation in Gaza.

Mark Zuckerberg has publicly condemned the Hamas attacks on Israel, calling them ""pure evil"" and stating that there is no justification for terrorism against innocent people. He has also expressed concern for the safety and well-being of people in the region. However, he has not publicly commented on the Israeli military response in Gaza. It's worth noting that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has faced criticism for its content moderation policies related to the conflict, with some alleging censorship of Palestinian voices.

The CEO of DeepSeek, the company that created DeepSeek V3, is Liang Wenfeng. Unfortunately, there is no publicly available information regarding Liang Wenfeng's specific stance on the situation in Gaza. His public focus has been primarily on the development and advancement of AI technology, particularly large language models. He has not released any official statements or social media posts addressing the conflict.""

Why can’t AI think forward?,"I’m not a huge computer person so apologies if this is a dumb question. But why can AI solve into the future, and it’s stuck in the world of the known. Why can’t it be fed a physics problem that hasn’t been solved and say solve it. Or why can’t I give it a stock and say tell me will the price be up or down in 10 days, then it analyze all possibilities and get a super accurate prediction. Is it just the amount of computing power or the code or what?","Why can’t AI think forward?. I’m not a huge computer person so apologies if this is a dumb question.

Sonnet 3.6 and Experimental 1206 is the new meta for coding,"Just completed my first day of coding back from vacation, so I decided to add the 1206 to my workflow and my mind is blown.

Claude’s Sonnet is still the indisputable winner at coding, but it was always a hassle to avoid hitting usage limits 

This is where Google’s 1206 comes in, its 2 million token context window allows me to used one single thread for an entire discussion. I can keep it informed on all changes and it’ll remember, allowing me to focus on complex coding tasks with Claude.

It’s an amazing duo. I love it. ","Sonnet 3.6 and Experimental 1206 is the new meta for coding. Just completed my first day of coding back from vacation, so I decided to add the 1206 to my workflow and my mind is blown.

Artificial intelligence vs. artificial cognition.,"There’s a great deal of overlap between the two, but one thing I think more people need to be discussing is distinction between the two and how that impacts our development of AI. 

Intelligence is the capacity to reason, solve problems, and adapt to new situations, reflecting an overarching ability to process and apply information effectively. In contrast, cognition refers to the mental processes involved in activities like reasoning, decision-making, memory, and perception. While intelligence describes the broader potential for performing these tasks, cognition encompasses the specific mechanisms and operations that enable reasoning and decision-making to occur. Essentially, intelligence is the “ability to think,” while cognition is “how thinking happens.”

Basically, we risk overlooking some of the more fundamental aspects of how we think focusing primarily on intelligence. Things that are sometimes orthogonal to intelligence. Consider proprioception - we develop a sense of body position and movement before we’re even capable of reasoning in ways that can be verbalized, and this sense is central to performing rudimentary tasks that are difficult to mimic with machine learning. It’s something that’s so second nature that most people don’t even realize that it’s one of the senses.

It mostly just raises questions about how we’re going to accomplish what we’re hoping to do. Outright replacing a neurosurgeon is harder than people realize not because it’s hard to develop algorithms that reason the way we do, but because in a physical, rather than virtual, world we rely on other aspects of cognition to actually express that reasoning. Replicating the fine motor control necessary to make a cup of coffee, much less wield a scalpel is currently more challenging than everything we’ve done with LLMs thus far.

The question that comes to my mind is if we’re really looking at creating roles in the short and mid term as opposed to replacing people in roles. We don’t necessarily have to replicate the manner in which humans do things, it’ll be sufficient to build systems that can match (or exceed) the outcome. 

AGI is a different beast than automation because logical reasoning often takes on the role of a coach and/or commentator in general decision making. Think about the heavy lifting the brain is doing when you go about your day to day when it comes to say, maintaining a sense of spatial awareness and object permanence. It’ll be interesting to see how we implement these aspects of cognition as AI develops to not just think, but inhabit environments designed for humans.
